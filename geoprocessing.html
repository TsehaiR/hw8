<h1>Homework 8 : Surface Water Supply Watersheds within Nuclear Exposure Zones </h1>
<p>Question:</p><br>
<p>How many surface supply watersheds would potentially be impacted by a nuclear power plant accident?</p><br>

 <h2>Making the Map</h2>
<p>The North Carolina watersheds were a vector layer downloaded from ncmap.gov. Points were created to denote the sites of nuclear power plants in and around North Carolina. The Emergency Planning Zone marking the ingestion exposure pathway was created using a buffer around each plant of 50 miles. The watersheds that overlapped with the buffer zones were found using the int

<h3>Impacted Watersheds</h3>
<p>The ingestion exposure pathway indicated the area around a nuclear power plant that can expect to be affected by radiation particles in the event of a disaster at a nuclear plant. This disaster may potentially affect drinking water. This map shows suface water sheds within a 50 mile radius of a nuclear plant. From this map it can be determined that watersheds around central NC are greatly impacted, while watersheds in the mountains of North Carolina are largely unaffected.</p>
